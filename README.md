# pokemon-dictionary
an attempt to create the same app with all the new and trending frameworks

## How it will all work?

I will open a branch for each language and combination of front framework and js server that I could think of.

If I have an idea of some new feature for the app I will try to add it in each and every branch I have. (debatable for now haha)

# pokemon dictionary
## what this app will have?
1. Page that will show the pokemon's 10 at a time (with right and left arrows to move to the next/prev page)
2. Page for every pokemon with some cool info about the pokemon with a picture

## Nice to have Features
1. some sort of auth (for the very least some indicator the user voted)
